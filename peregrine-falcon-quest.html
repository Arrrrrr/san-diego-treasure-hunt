		<h1 class="title">The Quest for the Peregrine Falcon</h1>
		<p class="text">The peregrine falcon is the fasted animal in the world, able to reach 240 mph when diving. They are carnivores, and dive through the air at high speeds to hunt their prey. </p>
		<p class="text">You can view wild peregrine falcons here in San Diego, especially around the sea cliffs. A good place to spot them is around Torrey Pines State Reserve.</p>
		<p class="text">
				<ol class="text">
					<li>Go to Torrey Pines State Reserve. (The cost of parking is $15 - 20)</li>
					<li>Go down the stairs across from the guard station at the park entrance.</li>
					<li>Walk South along the beach, and keep an eye on the cliffs for falcons.</li>
				</ol>
		</p>
		<p class="text">This quest takes patience, and you may need to visit the reserve a few times before you see a falcon.</p>
